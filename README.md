# LinearWebsite

This is a **clone of the Linear homepage**, built purely with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and a bit of JavaScript. It's a static frontend project aiming to replicate the clean and modern UI of [linear.app](https://linear.app).

## 🚀 About This Project

This is my **first website** as I begin my journey into web development. I chose to clone the Linear homepage because it has a sleek, minimal design and uses modern web design patterns. The project helped me learn the basics of:
- Writing clean HTML structure
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Handling responsive layouts
- Working with custom fonts, SVGs, and animations



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (minimal)
- Fonts & SVGs for design

## 📁 Folder Structure

```bash
LinearWebsite/
│
├── index.html
├── style.css (if separate from Tailwind)
├── /images
├── /svg
├── tailwind.config.js
└── README.md
````

## 📚 What I Learned

* Basics of responsive web design
* How to set up Tailwind CSS
* Organizing a frontend project
* Attention to detail when replicating UI

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aymankhan89/LinearWebsite.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.
3. If you're using Tailwind via CDN, you're ready. If not, you'll need to install Tailwind CLI to build styles.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

* Inspired by [linear.app](https://linear.app)
* Tailwind CSS docs were super helpful

## 📌 Note

This is a **learning project** and not affiliated with Linear in any way. Constructive feedback is welcome!
